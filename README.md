## Research title: Application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) on Chaotic Climate Systems
This repository includes the code used for my research project and my presentation. The code is created on Juytper notebooks and uses Pytorch. 

## Presentation

Here is our model's prediction on the Lorenz System:

Here is our model's prediction on the Burgers' Equations:

Here is our model's prediction on the Navier-Stokes Equations over time:

Here is the residual, or the difference between our model's prediction on the Navier-Stokes Equations and the true solutions:

We are working on applying our model for the Navier-Stokes equations on ORAS4 satelite data with a 1x1 resolution.
